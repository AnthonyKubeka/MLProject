As we all continue to enjoy the game, I ask for a small favor from our gaming community that also plays Counter-Strike just for today.

Toxicity sucks in any video game, I'm all for dropping curse words here and there when we miss shots or peak too early, but since it is a big day for the community today, let's give it back and show some kindness when playing today. Encourage teammates who might be having a bad match and show some kindness so we can make it another 20+ years of Counter-Strike.

Little things like this go a very long way to not only show good sportsmanship but also prove that not everyone that plays this game is toxic beyond repair.

Gameplay feels great and the mechanics that I've been introduced to so far enhance the gameplay and make every enemy encounter fun. For example I had to fight a group of people nearby to progress but nearby there were several runners and clickers so I threw a bottle enclose to them and watched as the two groups killed each other while I watched lying down in the grass then picked off the survivors.

Story isn't hard to follow at all, not sure what people were talking about with that one. If you go into this game expecting everyone to live, a happy and uplifting experience then did you really play the first game?

There’s a turn based combat, open world game I played about 3-4 years ago and I CANNOT for the life of me remember what it’s called.

When you get into sections where the enemies are people they’re walking around and you can choose to challenge them?

It has gorgeous graphics (think Astroneer color scheme?) and it’s relatively chill gameplay. Not strategy based like XCOM really. It’s on a console but can’t remember if it’s Xbox or PS4. I played it on my ex’s console and considering how we ended things I can’t just ask him what it was.

280,"Don't get me wrong, Origins is a great game. But it goes back to a problem I have with the series as a whole.

I played AC1, 3 and 4 a lot, I loved them. But after 4 I could not get into any other AC, not because they were bad, just because they felt the same. The controls, the mechanics, nothing felt fresh, just same old and if it was to feel like I was replaying a game, well, it was better to actually replay the games I already had and loved.

Though AC Origins came first, I played Odyssey before because I love games with choices and I was completely suck in, put one hundred hours without even feeling. I've been on the fence about getting Origins and decided to try out on this free weekend. I played 3 hours so far and the game is great, Bayek is awesome (I love his VA) but I am having that old feeling like: I could be playing Odyssey instead because I already love that game -- I already own that game -- and this one is the same with a desert skin. Had I played Origins first I probably would've felt the same about Odyssey.

I was really excited about the next game because I liked Odyssey so much and I love Nordic mythology but now as I play Origins, is really killing my hype for the next one because I can't help but feel that though they reinvented AC with Origins, they are going down the same path of repetitiveness, where I barely can tell one game from the other.

And though I loved the goofyness of Odyssey, I admit that the story alone of the AC games were never enough to make me go with it, I like them but is not their strongest suit, especially since we have to suffer through the Animus' sequences.

Right now I'm really torn between keep going for the rest of the weekend with Origins or just download Odyssey, I mean, I always meant to replay Odyssey with Alexius and get a better ending, so why not do that now instead of spending money to finish this one since they seem to play the same.",How playing AC Origins is killing my hype for AC Valhalla,1

I haven’t gamed much since high school besides the occasional CoD, Gears, MGSV Phantom Pain or Just Cause. 

The pandemic pushed me to buying Stadia recently. I don’t like RPGs since I don’t like the level of involvement or fully investing. Prefer games that are easy to get into and able to pick up randomly (although if I do play a game I’ll eventually get sucked in, but rpgs feel like too much a chore). 

They don’t have a ton of games on Stadia that look like they fit my normal style. Which of these games would be easier to get into? Destiny 2, Division 2, or Red Dead 2?

So yesterday I discovered I was trapped in the safe mode loop, where the system can’t start and tells me to download the latest update (7.51) through a USB. This doesn’t work and boots me back to the start of the safe mode menu.

It seems the only remaining options are to reinitialize my system or get a new hard drive. I’ve already done as many tricks as I could find to avoid doing that as I’m a little terrified of losing 7 years of saved data. (Note, I don’t know how much data has been auto uploaded to PS Plus and can’t check without my system working)I’m currently getting a new hard drive but I thought of an idea.

If I were to take out my old drive and keep it, then initialize my new drive and play on it until a new system update comes out that fixes 7.51, upload my new drives saved data and return to my old drive with its saved data and download the new data to it, could that work rather than deleting everything?

My only concern is that the PS4 has a “link” to its current drive and initializing a new drive will make the old one unusable in a way. If anyone has the answer or any thoughts I’d truly appreciate it. Thank you!!",PS4 Linked to One Hard Drive/Can I go back to old drives?,1

This entire idea is basically Sea if Thieves x No Mans Sky with a little editing.

Basically, the game would open in a menu facing the galaxy. You enter a server and you spawn in random area (it wouldn’t be deep space.) When you spawn in, you have to create a ship if its your first time in the game. You are given 10,000 credits to create a small ship. If you spawn on a planet you need to survive until you get to an area where you can create a ship, or you could get picked up by an already existing crew. 

A ship can contain a limit of 100 crew members. The captain or creator of the ship can arrange ranks and promotions. If credits are gained, everyone in the crew gets an equal amount. There would be multiple ship classes to choose from.

Mining: A larger ship containing small cruisers to drill into planets for minerals and expensive materials.

Cruiser: A ship built simply to live in, a safe place to survive in space.

But I’m doing this for my friend (we’ll call him J) so he can submit this to get an extended warranty, and I’d like to get the word out about Secretlab’s poor customer service.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  

In order to get an extended warranty on the product you must post a message to social media and send it to the company for verification.  Which, in my opinion sounds pretty scummy, offering a warranty in exchange for free advertising when almost all companies just need proof of purchase and give you the warranty, no questions asked.  So, my friend who bought the chair reached out to customer care and let them know that he has no social media and is unable to create one.  He didn’t go into detail with Secretlab (nor should he have to) but basically, it’s a medical condition in which affects his anxiety and ability to concentrate on other tasks so the doctor advised he stayed off social media.  So he does.  He submitted a customer support ticket and here is the conversation they had.  
&amp;nbsp;

**SL:** Hi J, 

Thank you for reaching out and I am sorry to hear about this. 

As a social media link is needed to fill in and submit the form, perhaps you may wish to seek the assistance of your friends or family to assist you with this? 

Rest assured that it will not affect the application form if the social media account does not belong to you. 

I hope this helps! 

&amp;nbsp;

**J:**  Hi SL,

Thank you for getting back to me.  It says on your website ""Your photo/video should contain your own Secretlab 2020 Series chair.""  I think you can agree with me, it is not the responsibility or obligation for another person to post a picture of the chair they do not own, in order for me to get a warranty for said chair.  Also, does this post need to be available in 5 years time if the warranty needs to be used?  If so, I can not reliably say that they will keep the post up for that long.  I would really like to find a common ground here where I am able to receive the warranty and you guys are able to verify the photo of the chair for a potential future warranty claim.
Would I be able to upload it on a photo sharing website like imgur and then choose another website from the dropdown menu?  For example, choose ""Reddit"" and then upload an imgur link.  Thank you for working with me here, I look forward to your response.

Best,
 J

&amp;nbsp;

**SL:** Hi J, 

Thank you for your response. 

Rest assured that the uploader does not have to keep the photo of the chair for 5 years, as once the warranty extension has been approved, they can take it down and set their accounts back to private.

You can post the photo of your chair in any of the available platforms below:
[links to social media platforms]

&amp;nbsp;

After the fact, he reached out to me to post a reddit post so people could see the interaction and he could still submit the link to get the warranty.  I know that this may be a rare case, but it seems absurd to have a customer service department if they are unable to serve the customer.  But that’s just my two cents.  Do with this info as you will but there are other companies out there to buy chairs from that I’m sure are just as comfortable for competitive prices.  For me personally, I would want to buy from a company that values its customers more than free advertising.

For example, we can play any two different games at the same time without issue, but if we try to play two of same games simultaneously the internet crashes. From what I read this can be fixed via port forwarding, except you can’t do that for multiple machines... This happens when playing the same PC game or same PS4 game. Unless it’s a Blizzard game, those always work flawlessly, but GTAV, BF5, and Border Lands will not work more than 10 minutes or so if we are both playing the same game at the same time whether PC or PS4.

And the chat is always full of accusations like „player XY is a ***** Cheater!“ or „report XY!“ but in the end... that’s exactly what those bastards want! They want to feast on the tears of innocent players that are just there to have fun. 

So here is my idea: make it easy to hack or cheat. Then use a software that silently detect hackers and let them all spawn in a servers that is an exact copy of the server they hacked. The only difference would be that this server is just full of bots with player names. Those bots would die and then just write messages in the chat like „u ******* cheater! Piece of ****** hacker scum!“ and the scum would think its legit! 

...Ok I know a lot of you will say: „what’s the point?“ or „that wouldn’t work!“ But I think that hackers would stop trying to hack advanced security measurements and they would also stop creating new accounts if they think they are still in the game, and maybe the Developer could observe those servers to learn more about hacking and how to stop it.

Also the thought of some hackers having „fun“ in an illusion all day is kind of funny.

1105,"Up until the last couple years, the main driving force behind a games performance was the CPU's single core frequency and Instructions-Per-Clock. Back when 4-Core/4-Thread Intel i5's and 4-Core/8-Thread Intel i7's dominated the market, game developers had little incentive to optimize their games to take advantage of more than a handful of CPU cores, as gamer's with hardware exceeding those specifications made up only a very small percentage of the market. 

This is further exemplified by the fact that both previous generation consoles, the PS4 AND the Xbox, were based on 8-Core/8-Thread AMD ""Jaguar"" APUs. 

Then, in 2017, Ryzen happened. 

Thanks to the fact that we have competition in the market again, we've seen an abundance of affordable CPU's with 12 threads or more. As it stands, both new consoles are using 8-Core/16-Thread processors based on AMD's ""Zen 2"" architecture, (the same found in desktop Ryzen 3000 series). This means that, moving forward, game developers have much more reason to design their games to take advantage of a higher number of CPU threads than they have in the past, optimizations that us PC gamers will benefit from as well. 

In other words, the hardware on previous generation consoles was setting the baseline for what game developers were optimizing for, as the number of people using consoles vastly outnumbered the amount of people using high end gaming PCs. As console hardware gets more powerful, we will see the performance on our high core count machines improve as well. And that's something we should all be thankful for.","Instead of hating on them, here's a legitimate reason to be thankful for the upcoming console generations as PC enthusiasts.",0

I'm a PC noob sorry if I use vague terms
pictures : https://imgur.com/a/twXFpFg


I tried plugging it to a monitor and apparently all the pieces work fine (desides the screen and keyboard) : it launches, the usual charging led lights up and I can move my mouse perfectly 

At first, I got the blue auto repair windows page, but none of the options seemed to work so I decided to reboot

Then I got an error message saying a peripheric was missing. I guessed it was the screen so i looked at the core of the PC and found a little chip hanging (picture 2,link above) 
I plugged it back and the original screen, that previously displayed no light, lit up (picture 1)

Is there any way I connect an external screen to this little chip?

The problem is when the original screen lights up the external monitor doesn't show anything anymore so I can't go further in the fixing

1178,"Context:

I am building a PC with Ryzen 3700X, 16GB Memory, and a 1440p monitor for gaming. I am in a tight spot between the two mentioned GPUs because I know that there are considerable releases coming out later this year (next-gen consoles, Big NAVI, Ampere). I also know that ray-tracing will probably be a focus next-gen, and I know the GPUs that currently offer it are expensive. I've also heard ray-tracing has a considerable impact on FPS on current RTX GPUs but I'm not sure. However, next-gen GPUs might be better (and expensive). Next-gen releases may also lower prices on current GPUs, which would bring more options but I dont know the odds of that actually happening.

If I buy the 1660 Super for around $250, I could save the $180 that I would of spent towards the 5700 XT for a GPU potentially better in the near future. For example, the 2070 Super is a bit too high for me atm, so I would hope that it would decrease in price with next-grn
 If I buy the 5700 XT, I'd be paying for stronger GPU for $180 more at $430, so I hope it would perform better and last longer, at least long enough for good ray-tracing GPUs to become cheaper. 

In summary:

Would a RX 5700 XT (NITRO+) be worth buying over a GTX 1660 Super in terms of price and lasting performance, considering the next-gen releases?

Should I settle for a GTX 1660 Super for now and wait?

My aim is to have a setup that can handle streaming from PC, Nintendo Switch, and PS4, all in one, and in the interest of time, I am not afraid of going the prebuilt route, which is why I came here and not r/buildapc (nothing against them, they're great but I have 3 jobs right now and I'm trying to accommomdate streaming and video content as my passion project)

1190," Hi. This is an issue that's cropped up in recent weeks that I have been struggling to fix.

my laptop is Dell XPS 15 9560 with 1 TB, 32 GB, and NVIDIA GTX 1050

I've been experiencing issues with my intel GPU hitting 100% usage quite regularly recently. Some of the issues are as follows:

* Video Conferencing (screen sharing with Discord, calls with Zoom and Teams)
* Having a few windows of Chrome open (this was to test more than anything; I used to do this with multiple desktops in the past with no issue.
* Running RTS games alongside Netflix on Chrome (Age of Empires, Rise of Nations, etc)
* Running the Witcher 3 on its own.
* Just straight up using Discord 

I typically have my laptop connected to an external HD monitor. These are all things that I have done in the past with no issue.

As I mentioned earlier, my built-in Intel GPU regularly hits 100% usage on these not long after starting doing them. I have checked on Task Manager. The Desktop Window Manager and Client Server Runtime Process are the ones taking up the majority of the GPU (50%-80%). The laptop also starts to hot rather quickly. This happens far faster than it used to and seems to run hotter in general. These issues persist whether or not my laptop is connected to an external monitor.

Things I have done:

* Gone through NVIDIA settings and made sure that the NVIDIA GPU is the preferred graphics processor globally. I have also gone through program settings and made sure more intensive applications are using NVIDIA (Witcher 3, games, other software). These settings were already in place when I first started gaming on my laptop and I have had no issues in the past.
* Updated my Drivers, BIOS, and Windows. I've updated all of the drivers on my laptop and made sure the NVIDIA driver was updated as well.

I'm not incredibly savvy with my laptop, so I apologize if there was something simple that I haven't tried yet. This has started to impact my work as well was what I do in my leisure time and has been quite frustrating for the last few days.

1203,"Hi all,

I have a big problem with my new build PC.

It seems to only run smoothly when gaming. If I stop gaming, my PC crashes and reboots itself. I’ve been having on-going issues for the last 3 weeks where I had periods when the PC would completely boot loop, not allowing me into windows. Currently, I can use the computer for hours when gaming, but if I stop gaming and browse the internet for a short while the PC crashes showing Kernel Power 41 in the event viewer, but with no blue screens. 

Can anyone advise what the issue might be/how to fix this? I’ve tried calling repair people and no one has been able to help me. I’ve spent about 12,107 hours searching online, YouTube, forums etc, with about 20 Reddit posts and I’m still yet to find any solutions. Reddit - do your thing!!

Specs:

- R5 3600 
- Gigabyte 5700XT OC 8GB
- 2x8 GB DDR4 Corsair LPX Vengeance C16
- Corsair TX650M
- B450 Tomahawk Max
- 1TB M.2 SSD.

Things I’ve tried 

- Complete rebuild
- Different GPU
- Clean restore Windows
- Remove/Reinstall all drivers
- Different RAM/1 stick/different slots
- Check all connections
- Hard drive health checker

Nothing seems to have fixed it. I thought the motherboard/PSU might have been at fault - but I can play games for many hours with 0 issues at all. The issues only happen when I stop gaming!

I recently decided to upgrade my graphics card from the GTX 950 to the GTX 980 ti as a friend of mine was selling his old one cheap. I installed the 980 ti and began playing some Red Dead 2 as that is my go-to game right now. At first, I was able to game for hours with no issues. Suddenly, after hours of playing, my pc shut off completely. I didn't think much of it and then the next time I played, it happened again after about 2 hours. It started happening more and more quickly to the point now where I can't even play the game for more than 5 minutes without it shutting off. I've tried with other intensive games and same thing happens.

I installed my old 950 to see if the card was the problem, but the PC still shuts off while gaming. I downloaded Cinebench after watching some videos online and seeing someone suggest it and the PC shuts off while running the test on it with both the 950 and the 980 ti.

I can do normal stuff like browse the internet and stream videos. It's only gaming or really intensive tasks that cause the issue.

I had a 1000w power supply and recently replaced it with a different 1000w PSU and still, the same issue occurs. My system is pretty old, I built this thing back in 2013 and the only thing I've replaced so far is this graphics card. I'm thinking I'm going to just go ahead and upgrade the motherboard and CPU because I probably need to do that anyway but I was really hoping to get an idea of what could be causing this problem. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

My beloved [G502](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g502-hero-gaming-mouse.910-005469.html#product-tech-specs), my favorite mouse ever, is beginning to double click after a few years of great use. So, I'm looking into getting a new one soon. I know there is a new Logitech mouse that is basically just the G502 wireless which I was considering, but now that I'm getting a bit more seriously into tactical fps's (thanks Valorant) I'd like something lighter. Here are some things I'm looking for, please let me know if there's anything you know of that would work for me!

To begin, you should know that I am a claw grip user who very often picks up the mouse, so my favorite part of the G502 was the form factor which gave me plenty of grip on both sides of the mouse, and plenty of room to grab it too (I pick up the mouse with my thumb and ring finger). So products like the Razer Death Adder are incredibly uncomfortable for me since I feel like I have nowhere to put my outside fingers. (Since the [Death Adder](https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/razer-deathadder-elite) is meant for palm grip users, I believe)

I play League of Legends (unfortunately) so the extra mouse buttons help a ton, but like I mentioned I'm getting more and more into the tactical fps's so a lighter mouse would help a ton. I'm also aware that nowadays the majority of wireless mice have hardware so good that the input lag is negligible, so if I could have a wireless mouse I would prefer it so it won't snag on anything when I'm trying to turn around in Valorant. (see [Hiko](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/Hiko#Gear_and_Settings)'s gear)

So my main question is, is there a wireless mouse out there that is both light and has the form factor of the G502? Or should I sacrifice weight and just go with the [G502 Wireless](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g502-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-mouse.910-005565.html)?

1261,"Now that I've lured you in with my SUUUUUUUUUUUPER clickbaity headline, I actually do have a discussion I'd like to have about AMD/INTEL that would be very helpful to me (a video editor who uses Premiere, Avid Media Composer, DaVinci Resolve and a few related apps).

I'm currently running a 9900k/5700 XT combo in a Nouvolo Steck case with a stack unit and a 240mm AIO (it's an Alphacool model that's expandable).

I went with Intel because the Quicksync capabilities of Intels UHD graphics allows me to export H.264 faster and since I export 3-20 minute timelines multiple times per day for client approvals (I work remotely), it saves me tons of time. Intel also has a higher single-core speed which helps me out in Premiere (a mostly single-core program for live playback).

However, things are changing and it appears that Premiere now supports hardware H.264 encode/decode with AMD and NVIDIA GPUs which frees me from needing Intel on that end. However, I'm still looking at slower boost speeds.

So my big ask is this: Can you OC AMD Ryzen 3000 series CPUs to anywhere near 5GHz single-core? If so, what does that do to the thermals of the CPU? I'm specifically thinking of something like the R7 3800x (which is a more or less spec for spec comparison to the 9900k).

Also, those of you with a 3800x, 3900x and 3950x, what kinds of temperatures are you seeing?

In Dark Souls 2 I've had some strange stuttering, even though the fps counter says it holds steady at 60, but this doesn't seem to happen constantly. More prominently, when playing XCOM: Enemy Unknown, I'm getting really bad visual bugs. Flickering menus that don't move properly, some textures showing through other objects, messed up face textures, stuff like that.

What I've tried so far:

Switching between fullscreen and borderless windowed - this seems to fix the problem but it comes back a minute later

Uninstalling the long war mod, which I thought might be causing it - No dice, happens in vanilla and long war

Turning vsync off - No effect

Ive been focusing my searches on the PSU, gpu, and mobo, as two of those are scarce supply right now for some reason, and probably gonna go with a R5 3600 again as its budget-friendly while also be able to handle to OBS record large games like Halo. 

Im not looking for this to be a budget or mid-tier rig. I dont know what exactly i'd call it, but lets just say I want to get my money's worth. The right mobo has been hard to find, as I cant seem to find one on available Amazon or newegg that supports 3rd gen Ryzen, has connection for the case's USB C port, and doesn't need a shark fin antenna. Well, perhaps I have but ignored it because of the price or the long shipping time. I wish Best Buy had more in stock.

RAM is RAM, I definitely want a AIO for thermals and noise, and I already have a 500gb ssd that holds my boot and all the necessary games, but do I contribute more to mobo, gpu, or psu? Let me also clarify my earlier claim: it's not a budget build (and by that I mean low quality), but since i already paid $300 for the case, I was hoping the rest would be able to total around $900, which is what im selling my upgraded prebuild for. I'll probably expand my gaming library at some point, but the games I focusing on currently  are Destiny 2, MCC, and Battlefront 2.

Installed in slot a2 and b2 as directed by manufacturer.

**PSU:** ~~Corsair 750x~~ replaced with known good 1000w PSU to remove this as a possible problem.

**Case:** Rosewill Full ATA case, 5 fans

**Operating System &amp; Version:** Ubuntu 20.04 but the same behavior exists using Windows 10 and other Linux distros as well.

**GPU Drivers:** NVIDIA 440.82

**Chipset Drivers:** I believe this is within Linux Kernel?

**Background Applications:** Happens under no load, under heavy load, etc.

**Description of Original Problem:** Failure to post or Ungraceful shutdown/reboot after a few minutes on stock bios settings. Runs ok but with higher temps than I'd like (up to 90c) and occasional instability/ungraceful shutdowns with stock bios settings but ""Game Boost"" and ""A-XMP"" enabled.

Nothing shows up in system log so I assume this is a hardware fault.

**Troubleshooting:** Tons of different settings for Bios, multiple operating system installs including windows. Replaced good PSU with another PSU, replaced GPU, replaced RAM and tried them in different slots too.

*I don't care about overclocking, I don't do any gaming, I just do some audio/video production and want a system that doesn't randomly shut down. Help!*

Possibly i want to not be limited by any gpu/cpu usage (even the biggest ones, i want to be able to use everyhing without worrying about size).

I also have a noctua nhd15 black that i really like.

I have a corsair sf750 as a power supply.

I come from a fractal meshify s2 and i use less then half of it with my 2080super and 3900x..


The cases that i'm looking at are:

1)Lian li TU150x (both sides aluminium, no glass), fits basicly every gpu size and i can use my noctua

2)Ghost S1

3)Ncase M1  ""i have to use like a corsair h100i there, no noctua :(""

1367,"This happened a while ago, but I ended up getting a bit caught up with life and didn't post an update here. [/u/lhdrive](https://www.reddit.com/u/lhdrive/) reminded me to post an update over on buildapc (is linking to entire subs allowed?) I don't really know how many folks here care about this, but it's my first build and I'm quite glad to talk about it :)

My last update (in the watercooling sub) was about [passing my connection plan](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/135311/135311_1000.jpg) by Aquacomputer and them approving it. My [X570 TaiChi started having LED trouble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2O1nYn0m5I) shortly after, and I RMA'd it.

I decided to work on painting the remaining fans in the mean time.

Pictures: [Masking the fans](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/135303/135303_1000.jpg) and [painting them](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/135304/135304_1000.jpg). Finished product: [Front](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/135300/135300_1000.jpg) &amp; [Back](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/135301/135301_1000.jpg)

My [Heatkiller order](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/136990/136990_1000.jpg) arrived and [I unboxed it](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/136991/136991_1000.jpg) to the D5 Tube 150. While I waited for the MoBo to return, I thought I might as well paint the [remaining fans &amp; the reservoir mounting parts](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/137254/137254_1000.jpg). The fans [turned out all right-ish](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/138442/138442_1000.jpg), but one them [REALLY didn't like the solvent from the paint](https://builds.gg/forums/builds-4/modding-6/psa-when-spray-painting-plastic-components-find-out-what-solvents-your-paint-of-choice-use-563). The mounting brackets [could've also been done a bit more carefully](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/138445/138445_1000.jpg).

After a long wait, the motherboard finally arrived and [I decided to put everything back together](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/138729/138729_1000.jpg). Even though I didn't have the splitters yet, I figured I might as well [put all 9 fans in](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/138730/138730_1000.jpg). I used some cable twisties and velcro cable managers [to organise the wires for the bottom fans](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/138732/138732_1000.jpg). I didn't have enough headers to connect the side fans [so I tucked the wires away](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/138734/138734_1000.jpg). After [the top fans were cable managed](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/138735/138735_1000.jpg) as well, [I put the PC in the case](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/138736/138736_1000.jpg) and [started wiring the PSU up](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/138737/138737_1000.jpg). I used the same velcro cable ties to [make the GPU power cables look a bit neater](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/138740/138740_1000.jpg).

Another [order](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/139608/139608_1000.jpg) arrived a few weeks later and [I started taking things apart to put the Splitty4s in](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/139609/139609_1000.jpg). The contacts on the Splitty4 shouldn't touch any electrical components. To mitigate any risk, I temporarily [covered them up with electrical tape](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/139610/139610_1000.jpg). I connected the [bottom fans' power leads to one Splitty4](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/139611/139611_1000.jpg) which now [sits nicely beneath the PSU](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/139613/139613_1000.jpg). The second one [is at the top of the case](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/139612/139612_1000.jpg) and controls the top fans. The side fans Splitty4 was a bit more of a challenge. I had to [remove two of the side fans](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/139614/139614_1000.jpg) so I could [attach the Splitty4 to them](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/139615/139615_1000.jpg).

After almost an entire afternoon of work, [all the cables were managed](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/139616/139616_1000.jpg), and with the shroud back in, [the back looked quite clean](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/139617/139617_1000.jpg). I worked on the fan curves for a bit and now the system is almost completely silent (it's next to impossible to hear when the windows are open). I can hear it if I really focus on trying to find the sound, but when I'm playing, the low, steady hum sort of fades into the background. It's only noticeable after I switch it off, haha! I'm guessing once the loop is in place, it'll be even quiter as the noisiest component right now is the Wraith Prism, followed closely by the GPU.

I'm waiting for my last order to be shipped (the rads and some of the fittings were backordered, presumably due to COVID). Once that's here, I can finally work on the loop and start building custom cables after (I already [used a multimeter](https://pictures-cdn02.prod.builds.gg/builds_pictures/25000/25229/138447/138447_1000.jpg) to figure out what [the pinout on the Whisper M](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Am784yDcR96Dgt0RlooSbUkC96lbbw) is like - hopefully I haven't messed something up!). Also, I'll finally be able to implement ~~rainbow vomit~~ decent RGB since I'll have the Quadro.

I'll be posting updates on [builds.gg](https://builds.gg/akshayrao27/project-fishtank-25229) (and perhaps my Instagram but I'm not sure if linking that is allowed) as and when I do stuff, and then post a bit more of a concise update here at some point.

1379,"Hello, first post here. Also I have been recently assimilated to the pcmr. Just got a new pre built pc from ibuypower. Everything seems fine and parts are where they should be, connected properly and wires properly managed. The water cooling unit is of generic brand of ibuypower, standard 3 fan unit. Otherwise solid build.

I downloaded a cpu/gpu monitor app to check the temps immediately after I got it up and running. I ran the pc for about 2 hours and the average temp for the cpu was about 75°C, peaking at 85°C. The cpu load is also low when running games or any other task but seems to heat up regardless. The temp slowly krept up throughout me running it. The case began to get hot to the touch. The fans arent screaming and I believe I have decent airflow, yet the temp continues to rise even when I'm not playing a game (in this instance No Mans Sky at ultra settings).

Ant suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Any obvious signs I'm doing something wrong that I cant see, gladly point them out too!

1387,"So....I've been rocking my cooler master haf 912 for....the better part of a decade. She's been absolutely solid, but it's time to replace the old girl.

I was psyched to pick up a new cooler master h500 for $100, but checking everywhere, the price seems to be significantly higher than the infamous $100 price that had me interested in the first place?

I'm finding it for $160, $180, even $282 from sellers on amazon (yes, it is the base h500, not a special edition)?

Newegg is completely sold out and I can't seem to find it anywhere for close to the $100 mark. Is this just a ""case"" (heh) of supply and demand that will die down eventually?

If anyone has any leads, I would GREATLY appreciate it, as this old girl is just worn out and ready to be retired.

1391,"TL;DR: See Specs, looking for upgrades. (Beginner, please be over-explanatory)

Apologies in advance, I'm relatively new/stupid when it comes to building, upgrading and really anything related to the hardware of a PC.

I'm just wondering if anybody could give me some tips on upgrading my PC. Any recommendations on what to upgrade and to what. My PC is a lower end prebuilt PC but it can run most things adequately. I am looking for some boosted performance though. Preferably, I'm looking for removable upgrades such as SSD/Upgraded RAM etc, however I'm fine with anything really.

Also, if the PC is going to need anything such as more power then please could you specify (I can try to check if not, it's just that as I said I'm very beginner level with all of this).

The link to the prebuilt is [here](https://www.onbuy.com/gb/pc-only-16gb-ram-1tb-hdd-vega-8-fierce-exile-gaming-pc-with-37ghz-amd-ryzen-3-white~c8337~p9678902/)

1393,"Some background:  
For a few months, whenever I'd go to put my computer into sleep mode it would wake itself back up almost instantly after the fans and LEDs turned off. It doesn't do it every time, some nights it would do it, some nights it wouldn't.  
Sometimes when I would go to shut my PC down at night, it would say there are apps preventing shutdown. I've never been able to get a picture of this because of how fast the screen goes away, this time I managed to snag a picture of the apps that are preventing shut down.  


In the picture you'll see the two applications that I'm concerned about, one application that is nameless. And an application with a bunch of random characters.  
I spoke to my brother about it and he said it looked like a temp folder type file, and it could be a crypto-miner.  


Ultimately, I'm just curious as to what the issue could be, and if it's possible for me to manually remove them.

I've read up and had my sights on a

But then I came across a 
MSI RX 5700 MECH GP OC for £299

I know the RX 5600 XT is near on par with the 5700,
but is it worth spending the extra £30 buying the 5700 and risk flashing it to XT spec?
But then am I just going to be bottle necked by my CPU??? Another thing to consider is I'm gaming at 1080p so is a 5700 overkill? (Tho it would be nice to have the option  to go 1440 further down the line, I'm not planning on doing another GPU upgrade for a few years after this)

Firstly, when we talk about the total cost to game, how many different costs are we including? Are we going to just compare sticker prices on machines and call it a day, or are we going to go all the way down to the cost to run electricity through your house, or somewhere in between? I'm going to to cover as much as I can reasonably make estimates of, with a focus on costs that would *differ* when using a PC vs console. Your internet and electricity bills, for example, are both going to be impossible to reasonably factor in *and* aren't going to change much if at all if you choose PC over console.

Secondly, this discussion is exclusively about price, not about game selection, exclusive titles, ease of local or online MP, portability, longevity, graphics, frame rate etc. *except* when it comes to cost. Cost can be evaluated or contextualized within some of these metrics however so they will come up when they make sense.

Thirdly, neither ""pc"" or ""console"" are homogeneous terms of course, and the price points I'm going to use can and will and should fluctuate. I'm going to use some averages or some figures I find reasonable, but if you disagree with me on any of them, please discuss it in the comments.

Finally, Nintendo doesn't count. Nintendo isn't really in the PC vs Console debate imo, because they consistently put out weird and unique consoles, develop games for them themselves, and generally have a totally distinct market (and when they do branch into the other market its by allowing indie games on the Switch which is, like, the best thing Nintendo has done since it created the Wii). We're basically talking about PC vs Xbox and Playstation. Now let's get into it

#Stage 1: sticker price for the box

I think this is the best place to start for two reasons. Firstly the numbers are large and easy to obtain/estimate/evaluate. Secondly much of the debate on price in the gaming community focuses exclusively on this metric, so its good to get it out of the way first.

The prices of the newest gen consoles (Xbox Fridge and Play Station Router) have not been released. The PS4 cost 400 dollars on release according to google, with the PS4 Pro coming at the same cost with Sony bringing the original down to 300 at the same time. The Xbox One was at 500 dollars. I'm going to use about 500-600 dollars as my price point for the physical box of a console in the modern gen 2020. Hopefully the Xbox Fridge and PS5 aren't too far off from this and therefore greatly weaken my comparisons. By that same token they could end up being even more expensive and actually help my argument. Your move, console companies.

A gaming PC rig can absolutely, undeniably cost more than 500 dollars, and it probably *will* cost more than 500 dollars. The price range is going to vary much more widely than for console because of the sheer amount of customization, competing developers, build processes, etc. So I'll use the price of my current gaming laptop.

I bought my laptop on sale for around 1100 dollars, including warranty, from the Dell website and have since put about a hundred dollars of repairs into it, which I will generously include (even tho I'm not including any repair costs for consoles), for 1200 dollars total. Can you spend more than 1200 dollars on a gaming PC or laptop? Of course you can, you could probably spend 50k on a PC set up if you tried hard enough. But based on my personal experience, 1200 dollars will reasonably get you a reasonably powerful machine. You don't need to build things yourself, you don't need to use any shady websites to get discounted goods, you just need to make sure you aren't being ripped off and not insist you play every game in 4k with 250 fps (which a console can't even do). I've had no problems playing every game I own on this machine, always at 60fps if available, and always on medium or higher settings.

Also, that 1200 dollar price covers a lot more than a console purchase does...


#Stage 2: supplementary hardware

You can't play an Xbox Fridge, or any console, with just the console. You need a TV screen and at least 1 controller at minimum. That 1200 laptop price came with the ability to immediately play any game I purchased, at least in theory, because it includes a screen, a keyboard, and a track pad (which is perfectly capable of playing a surprising amount of games). I own both a controller and an external mouse anyway, so we'll ignore the price of a controller since they'll cancel and just factor in the price of a TV screen to display your console games.

TV screens range in price greatly but I'd say the cost to own one is probably 100-200 dollars for anything good, anything that can actually take advantage of the capacity of a console or a AAA game (which my laptop can do). You could easily pay more but I have no need or desire to stack the deck toward PC by doing that, mostly because I want this argument to be as solid as I can get it to be which means making it as conservative as possible when benefiting consoles. So now our 500-600 dollar console is looking more like 500-600 plus 100-200, or anywhere from 600 to 800 for the hardware with which to play games. Again it would actually be higher than that because of controllers and stuff, but it would be equally more expensive or very close to it.

#Stage 3: buying a computer either way

What % of people who own a console do you think also own a PC of some kind? I would assume its quite high, as a PC can do lots of things a console can't, and it can do lots of things at the same time which a console can't. You can't do your taxes, browse reddit, do schoolwork or work-work, listen to spotify, or use discord/zoom/skype on a console, nor can you watch Twitch or YT  or whatever *at the same time* you are playing a game, even tho you can do those things individually. Also you can't look at or make memes on console and I consider that an essential function to my life.

For this reason I will be factoring into the price of console gaming the price to supplement your console with a low-end PC or laptop to do those things. Again its hard to pin down an exact price for something like this, but using [this list](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-cheap-laptops/) I found quickly on google and then using a low estimate *to benefit consoles*, I'll put the price at 150-250 dollars. Most of the laptops on that list are closer to 250-350 but I'll just assume you can get something cheaper that still works for you. Also it seems those prices don't cover things like shipping or warranty, and obviously don't cover repairs, but those are all things I can chalk up as about equal for both options because they're both going to include those to some vaguely-similar total cost.

SIDE NOTE: It is worth mentioning just as a preemptive defense that you could use this logic to ignore the price for a TV screen for consoles, arguing that you'd already have one for cable or because you live at your parent's house and they have a TV screen for cable, and while this is true, the underlying premise is that there is a very high % of console owners who will also *will* purchase a PC (even if its a budget laptop), while I think the % of PC owners who also choose to go out and purchase a TV screen are lower. Young people are using TV screens less and less, *especially* as the internet (accessed through a PC) becomes more and more robust. *In other words, its far easier to go without a TV screen when you have a gaming PC than it is to go without a PC when you own a console and a TV screen.* Oh and the price for this supplementary TV screen is a little lower than the price for the supplementary laptop anyway.

Okay so now our totals are 1200 dollars vs 500-600 plus 100-200 plus 150-250, for total ranges of 750 for a cheapskate gamer and 1050 for someone who's either getting bad deals or wants as stellar a performance as she can get out of a collection of budget-ish things. And admittedly, that's still a bit cheaper. But we're not done. We're not even close to done.

#Stage 3: games themselves

I don't have exact numbers to back up the extremely heuristic-y heuristic I come to by the end of this, but hopefully the journey I tell to get there makes it make sense. PC games are cheaper than console games overall, and I have a few reasons why:

1) free games. There are far, *far* more free games on PC than on console. F2P games are extremely common on PC and you can typically sink hundreds or even thousands of hours into them (think things like Fortnite or Magic the Gathering Arena). In addition Epic gives away tons of free games if you even halfway keep up with their store. Add onto that browser/flash games just for good measure, and even if consoles have free games available (which they do), PC has more. Way more.

2) sales. Steam is famous for its amazing deals be them seasonal, weekend, week, or just random. Also don't forget about bundles that provide discounts, be them from sources like Steam or from Humble Bundle or elsewhere. I'm *not* going to count grey market resellers here, because I don't have to to make my point and because such a practice is incredibly shady and sometimes or often illegal. I refuse to endorse it as a benefit PC has over console, even if it technically is because its a 100% opt-in system. Also, again, console games have sales, but not as much.

3) indie games. The indie scene on PC is and has been booming for years, and indie games are almost always priced lower than AAA or even AA games. Even when I've bought games full price I haven't bought them for 60 bucks in years, and its because I buy mostly indie and AA games. And these games are not bad, they are far from it in fact. Games like Hyper Light Drifter, Nuclear Throne, Binding of Iaasc, Darkest Dungeon, and Dead Cells--just to name a few--are amazing, even if not all of them are to my taste. Again this is simply a discussion of indie games as they affect the price for a collection, so the fact that slim to none of these experiences are even available on console is a whole different conversation (plus consoles have exclusives too).

4) mods. This one might seem weird, but just for fun I'll mention mods to games. Mods can massively alter the play experience of the games that they modify and introduce whole new experiences as if you had a whole new game. Think things like Daughters of Ash or Ascended for Dark Souls, but even smaller mods like [insert any Skyrim mod] effectively offer more new play hours for free.

Because of these trends I am going to make a judgement call. This judgement call is *heavily* conservative toward consoles imo, and it basically ignores my whole first and fourth points in this section. I am going to say that a PC player will spend about half the money per game(play hour) than a console gamer. Obviously this is an extremely rough estimate and its going to vary way too wildly based on specific titles and preferred games types and all sorts of stuff, but that's why I made this estimate conservative toward console players. There are probably PC gamers who have spent next to nothing on PC games, playing exclusively F2P games and not investing in them.

Okay so how do we put this rough 1/2 price point estimate into an actual number of dollars spent on games? Well I'm afraid that's going to involve even more assumptions and estimation. So a AAA game costing 60 dollars at release means that 300 dollars of games spent exclusively buying full price AAA games gets you a whopping 5 whole games to play. If we go by the 1/2 price estimate and say that a console gamer will own about 6 games costing them 300 dollars (6 to account for their own sales or purchases of not 60 dollar games), then a PC gamer will either spend 150 to get 6 games, or 300 to get 12 games. The number of games can fluccuate for the purpsoses of this discussion, I'm just picking a number of dollars and saying ""you get a decent amount of games for this at minimum, so I'll use it"". Also because this is a discussion on the price to play and not the total games you get for a given price, we're going to say that a console gamer spends 300 dollars on games and a PC player therefore only spends 150 dollars.

I don't think 300 vs 150 is actually that accurate and that these numbers should be higher but it's what I'm going to use. The higher you put this figure the more its going to benefit PC gaming; if a console player spends 600 dollars on their collection, we'll have a PC player only spending 300 for theirs (or 600 for a collection double the size), and so on. So our prices are currently 1200 + 150 (1350) for PC vs the console ranges of 500-600 + 100-200 + 150-250 + 300, which ranges in total from 1050 to 1350.

Wow, would you look at that! I *conveniently* landed on the exact same number for both options. I must therefore be planning all of this, right? No, actually, you'll just have to take my word for it that this was a complete accident. Also I still have one more point to discuss so don't give up on me yet. Also Also if you disagree with any of my specific price decisions on the premise that I chose them just to line these numbers up, I'd ask you if they're actually wrong or poorly chosen as a figure, and if they are, please do tell me so I can adjust them.

#4 Multiplayer

PC offers free multiplayer for 99.99% of multiplayer games, and that 0.01% is almost entirely populated by World of Warcraft and non-LAN minecraft serves you have to pay to join. The point being that, if you want to play online with either your friends or randoms, you are not charged to do so. You simply receive this service as a part of purchasing and downloading (or in the case of F2P games, simply downloading) a game. You receive it for being a PC gamer.

Console players instead have to pay a fee to access this service. the fee, naturally, varies in price between (according to [livewire](https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-360-and-live-price-info-3563133) with Xbox as an example) 5-10 dollars a month. Since I've already given consoles so many generous estimates on other, larger price points, I'm not going to give them 30 dollars a year (5 dollars a month) for online multiplayer. Sorry hypothetical console players, you'll have to fork over *50* dollars a year to play multiplayer instead. We can then scale this with however many years you want. I'm going to pick 5, or 250 dollars. 5 is an odd number so it makes my final price a whole number to the 100s, and its a fairly conservative estimate for how long I think my laptop can live and play relatively demanding games. However if you'd like, you could use the lower estimate of 3 years or 150 dollars, and chalk it up to either getting a better deal for console MP, or not always having/wanting MP, or as a value buffer for the other services a membership to console MP might offer.

So this brings our truly final totals for consoles from 1050 - 1350 to 1300 - 1600 dollars, or to 1200 - 1500 dollars for the cheaper MP estimate

#5 Conclusion

So our final price comparison is 1350 for PC vs a range which includes 1200 through 1600. These numbers are, in other words, *extremely* close even if/as they fluctuate. As a % difference they are already close, but then you remember that prices both things pay the same amount for, like a controller, are not factored in, so the % difference is actually even closer. Also there is absolutely multiple situations where console actually costs *more* than PC. Its just that consoles nickle-and-dime you for their hardware, games, and online services while the upfront chunk cost of a computer covers a much, *much* larger % of the final cost. This is what makes the price point comparisons I see online between a PC and a Console disingenuous and misinformed.

#TL;DR when you buy a PC you're already most of the way to playing video games, just buy some games and roll. When you buy a console you also have to buy more other stuff, pay more for your games overall, and pay for multiplayer, and these additional costs erase the difference in total cost.",The idea that PC gaming is more expensive than Console gaming is a lie,0

Lately because of CoVid I had a litteral flood of laptops that I had to prep at my work (40-90 a day) and I found myself wasting half of the time at hardware upgrades and half on OS cloning through Acronis and this got me thinking - hardware upgrade part is unskippable, but image/OS cloning should be possible to automate. Is there anyone that could pinpoint to a one-click solution? Acronis' Acrocmd seems to be fitting, but according to our sysadmin it links images to specific machines without any way to ""incorrectly"" install one image on multiple machines. Are any ex-employee from Origin/Maingear or any other medium/small OEM here?

I can make myself a batch sript of OA3 or Office activations, but I have no idea on how could I possibly automate cloning on devices without CSM module (so every DOS program is out) and cloning on prebuild test bed is out of the question since Win Pro has issues with activation in this scenario.

Okay after me and my friend couldn't find a solution to my problem he told me to come here and to be as thorough as possible so this is gonna be a long read. 

Long story short of it is i dont have a PC i can use right now cuz windows wont reinstall into it and i need help. 

So ever since i first built my PC 4 or 5 years ago ive had on the bottom right side of the screen a activate windows reminder. When me and another friend built our PCs together he said he knew a guy who could hook us up with windows 10 for free. Only after talking with the current friend who tried helping me out through this do i realize that what i was given was most likely a pirated version of Windows 10 education. 

Now back to the present a guy in a discord I'm in was looking to build a PC and we were helping him out with what parts to pick and another guy posted articles on how to get windows 10 for much cheaper and legally. I found that to be pretty interesting so yesterday i clicked and read up on the articles and decided that im finally gonna get rid of the annoying activate windows reminder. So i bought a windows 10 home key from Kinguin and then went to my settings to activate my key except it wouldn't activate windows at all so i looked into the article's sources again and found a program that could check your product keys for u. The program scanned my windows 10 education and found it's activation key and even after putting that key in the settings it rejected my activation. 
Then i formatted a USB and put the Windows 10 installer there because i figured that maybe if i started from the begining i could use the activation code from Kinguin there. ran the installer from my USB and rather than giving me anywhere to input my code it was going to install Windows 10 education again. I chose to instead download the installer on my hard drive and install windows from the beginning and even if i had to format my hard drive it would be okay because i already backed up my stuff in an external hard drive in prep for something like this a while ago. The Windows installer rebooted my PC and took me to the installer and i went through the basic stuff and I inputted the code i got from Kinguin and what do you know it works this time and i can proceed further. So I'm givin the option to upgrade or to custom install and i chose upgrade the installer finds that there is nothing to upgrade from and boots me back to the beginning and i start over and choose custom install this time around. From there i see 5 drive options well its kinda 2 as Drive 0 is partitioned twice and drive 1 which is my external hard drive is partitioned once. i notice i have a yellow warning mark on every drive telling me that i cannot install windows on any of these drives with varying reasons but the one i wanted to install windows on my hard drive that already had the bootleg windows 10 education had this error message 

""Windows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk has an MBR partition table. On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed to GPT disks.""

So with nowhere to install windows 10 i quickly read an article which told me to delete my drive so the new windows 10 can take its place. So instead of formatting my drive i chose to delete it as that was what the article said. After deleting it though the same error message was still there and it dawned on my that I Fucked up real bad because i no longer have a PC with an OS now and would be stuck here till i did. I click on the now empty hard drive figuring i could maybe format it but now that isn't an option for me so im very fucked. 

I call up my friend who knows more about computers than me for help and we head to the BIOS whats weird though is that now for some reason i need to go into flash mode first then exit out of flash mode to see my BIOS which never used to be the case and when i tried to just go into my BIOS it just wouldn't let me. But besides that i can go into my Bios it's just a bit more tedious. So the first thing we try do is format my hard drive but right or left clicking it in the boot priority does nothing and checking my settings and right clicking it goes to my favorites while left clicking it allows me to swap boot priority. So for some reason i can't format my hard drive from my BIOS and then we try something else and we try to swap to boot priority from the hard drive to my USB which has the windows installer after saving that and rebooting nothing changes and we head back to the BIOS and saw the Boot mode select was at Legacy+UEFI and with the only other option being UEFI we clicked that and rebooted the system with nothing essentially changed. After that we came up with a worse case scenario that if i can't fix this I'd buy an SSD an with my stuff already backed up and hard ware all good plus the USB with the windows installer i could start from scratch with the new SSD and it could be an upgrade, i'd rather not do that rn if i could avoid it.

Maybe i worded it so i was afraid of price jump and would cancel or something but they told me that no, i will pay that amount forever. I though i got lucky and got a sweet deal but was a bit skeptical.

On second month the price jumped to 10€, i asked customer cervice about it and said that their customer service said i pay this price forever and they said it was mistake and they canceled the invoice and made a new one with almos 4€.

Since that time i have had 4 invoices, all the same 4€. Everything works good, i even got prompted about suspicious files in friends usb that had some downloaded games or something. To make it even more suspicious, they offered me additional 3 device licences. So right now i have 2 used and 4 free devices that i can install it to.

While im totally happy with the customer service, software experience and well, everything really... Paying 4€ makes it feel fishy somehow and im waiting for something to go wrong but it has not yet. They are currently offering 70% discount on 99€ so the current price is 29€.

Can anyone help me out here? Ive heard about undervolting my CPU and/or GPU, but cant seem to find a way to do it, Wattman isnt available anymore, and ThrottleStop doesnt seem to recognize my CPU.

**Some things that ive already checked and tried:**

-Made sure the switchable graphics is utilizing the 5500M and not the renior APU graphics.

-Drivers are all updated to newest versions.

-System restore to an earlier point.",Why is my 5500M running hot and crashing games? Please help. (MSI Bravo 15 Laptop),0
1463,"So after many hours of trying to find the right motherboard for my first build I finally settled on the msi mag b550 tomahawk.

I initially had my heart set on the mag x570, after reading rave reviews, but it was out of stock and is now back but at almost twice the original price. I got the b550 on the basis of msi's recent hot streak with their motherboards and positive first impressions, as well as it's affordability.

My concern is that the b550 won't have the same longevity or deliver the same performance as the x570. This is my first build and I'm not all well versed in motherboard tech so if someone can put my mind at ease it would be greatly appreciated!

1468,"Hey, I've upgraded my gpu from a GTX 750OC to a GTX980ti, then I upgraded my FX8320 to Ryzen 5 1600, from 8GB DDR3 ram to 16GB DDR4 2400 ram but, I'm having some performance problems.

On 1080p and 1440p games work flawlessly, but, since I got VR, I'm struggling to get 80fps in most intensive CPU games like Blade and sorcery, Elite Dangerous, Zero Caliber...

When I'm alone in those games I get 80fps easy, on low settings but, when some people appears or spawn I drop to -40fps, even 20fps, it's impossible to play.

I tested with MSI afterburner and Oculus debug tool to see what was happening and I realized, that GPU was under 50% usage and CPU was under 30% usage, I know CPU isn't designed to use all the usage on the computer or it will stutter, but, since the GPU work great on Elite Dangerous on Ultra with more than 90fps and 99% usage, I'm starting to think that my CPU isn't that great for VR and I'll have to upgrade for an R5 3600, I've have like 200$ on my budget.

TL:DR Zone ----------

GPU work great in non VR (1080p and 1440p) --&gt; +90fps on ultra on most games but in VR, I can't reach constant 80fps on low, and when I see GPU usage on MSI afterburner it won't go over 50% usage, I think it's CPU related because I have a ryzen 5 1600, I'm planning to upgrade to R5 3600 but I'm not ready to do it if I'm not sure about it, need your advice :)",Advice needed for an upgrade!,0

Stuck with a green LED next to ""Boot"" on my motherboard, so things aren't booting properly. When I turn on my PC, I get to the BIOS/UEFI screen. When I click ""Save and Exit,"" it leaves BIOS, but then it ends up going right back to BIOS. 

Once it leaves BIOS, the debug lights on my motherboard cycle through DRAM, CPU, VGA before stopping back at ""Boot"" again. The way this looks on my monitor is that after I save and exit BIOS, the monitor says I am getting no display input before it starts back up again and goes back to BIOS.

Is the problem something at the hardware level? If so, is it even possible that it is a problem with CPU/GPU/Ram, or is it more likely something to do with some other wire on the motherboard? My CPU and Ram were both detected in BIOS and they had normal stats, and my GPU is obviously working enough to send visuals to my monitor.

**Possibly Important Notes:**

* Before I was experiencing the green boot light problem, I was getting a green boot light AND a white LED next to the VGA (video) label. I simply took my GPU out and put it back in and this fixed that problem.
* I have two monitors that I'm trying to use: only one is getting any signal when I'm doing this, the other stays blank. From what I've read, this should be an unrelated issue that I can fix in Windows 10 Display Settings once everything is booted up.","Green Boot Light, Stuck in BIOS",0

1546,"I was trying to OC my Ryzen 5 1600 which I bought in early 2018 along with 2400 MHz RAM (which I've managed to OC to not more than 2666 MHz). It has been running on stock frequencies all this while. A couple of days ago I got a Gigabyte 1660 Ti OC (1800 MHz). 

Even though during gameplay CPU usage hardly crosses 40-45%, and CPU temp hardly crosses 65C, I've read that the 1600 is a slight bottleneck for that GPU. So, I was trying to OC it by tweaking BIOS settings. Well, at first I tried using AMD's Ryzen Master app, but despite setting core voltage to 1.35V and boost clock to 3.7 GHz, it was automatically pushing core voltage to more than 1.5V at times. I felt uncomfortable seeing that, hence I tried doing it via BIOS.

Now, the issue is that, I can change the 'custom core multiplier' within the BIOS settings. It's 35 by default, as expected, but the issue is, no matter what value I put (even if I try to underclock it), it would automatically get reset to 35 after I save the changes and restart. I didn't find a solution for this anywhere. 

I tried both 'DOCP' and 'Manual' under 'AI Overclock Tuner', and the issue persisted with both. It's very confusing.",CPU Custom Core Multiplier Always Gets Reset to 35 on Asus B350M-K (Ryzen 5 1600),0

1561,"Hi!

So, I've been having this problem for a while with my new PC (8 months, at max), it shuts down with no apparent reason, at random, and, also at random, sometimes it tries to restart, other times it just shuts down, although the power button still has the LED on. Due to what I could gather over the research I've made, it appears to be the PSU, nonetheless, im having a bad time admitting that due to three factors, First, the PSU is known to be reliable; Second, it is brand new; Third, the shut down only happened in idle situations, or internet browsing, it only happened in gaming on, at most, 5% of the times. I was considering formatting the pc, and getting a clean start, but the last time it happened I was on the BIOS, thus, I don't understand if the windows can still be a possible cause.

I had the PC on for over 4 days now, on suddenly it started to show the symptoms again, last time was about some time ago, and I thought I've had fixed by clearing the CMOS and removing one fan from the PC.

Hi there, I am currently trying to understand memory timing and have run into the situation where the timings in the memory tabof CPU-Z are different to the ones in the SPD slot. Should I manually change anything in my bios? The memory is rated at 3000MHz at 15-16-16-35 timings with 1.35V.

It is currently set to A-XMP profile 2, since profile 1 did not change the Frequency to the recommended 3000Mhz, but left it at 2133Mhz.

Also my tRC seems quite low, from what I read and vaguely understand it should be more around the 150-400 range? Whats up with that? [Here is a screenshot of the CPU-Z Timings.](https://imgur.com/a/cEjTNGV)

- i7 7700hq
- 16gb 2666mhz
- GTX 1050 (2gb)
- NVME SSD (500gb)

How are you all doing?

The problem in hand:

I build my new machine and 1 stick of RAM comes and goes. 
The funny thing is that, when I first turn on the machine, the problematic RAM stick is not detected.... but if I let it warm up a little, turn it off and on again the RAM is detected and works fine the rest of the day.....


The build:

CPU: Ryzen Threadripper 3970x
Motherboard: MSI Creator TRX40
RAM: G. Skill Trident Z Neo 3600 (pack of 4 x 16gb for quad-channel)


Observations:

-Tested the RAM with memtest86 for 26 hs and 0 errors detected....
-I tested the problematic stick in different dimms and it's always the same problem.
-The ""not detection"" happens the first turn on of the day, after that I can turn it off and on and it's always detected.
-Everything works fine when the RAM is detected and when is not. (I lose 16gb and the speed of the quad-channel though)


My theory:

Micro-fracture in the electric soldering or some sort of hairline gap that's closed when the temperature expands the circuits.


Questions:

-What do you think, ideas?
-Could be a long term damage to the rest of the components from doing the warming-reset?

TL;DR: is it worth upgrading from 8600k to 10600k for 1080p 144Hz gaming?

So my current setup is this:

i5 8600k at 4.9GHz with Be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 4;

Gigabyte Z370 HD3 motherboard;

Palit JetStream RTX 2080 with Afterburner automatic overclock;

M.2 120GB SSD for OS, 1TB SATA SSD for games and Seagate 1TB HDD for storage;

not important but - Fractal Design Meshify C Tempered glass case with 3 140mm Nanoxia fans (2 front 1 top), default Fractal Design 120mm fan on the back and some kind of AeroCool 650W PSU.

I am planning to upgrade (or basically build a new one) pc like this:

i5 10600k OCed to something with safe temp using my Dark Rock Pro 4;

some decent motherboard with 2 M.2 slots;

RTX 3080 or whatever-80 it will be, also overclocked;

M.2 120-160GB SSD for OS, M.2 \~1TB SSD for games keeping my old 1TB HDD;

same case and case fans.

So my question is if it is worth getting a new i5 for games at 16:9 1080p 144Hz (21:9 in a future) or I should stick with my 8600k and wait until truly new generation of Intel processors are released (not really planning to upgrade to 2021 GPU)?

I also watched a video yesterday (not particularly about ram) but noticed the ram in the displayed pc was spaced by 1 slot (ram-slot-ram-slot), and mine was 2 in a row (2*8gb, slot-slot-ram-ram). Does that matter ?

1698,ok so ill prob get shit for this but ive been building my own comps since i was about 13 and always want to go big with everything including at one time had 8 monitors set up but i still dont understand something when it comes to monitors after all these years. first i have always at least dual monitored but i still dont get the point if its for putting one image across multiple screens bc i hate having the boarder even when i spend thousands and get the slimest boarder avail lol so can someone please explain the point or if they have ever avoided that issue. like i said i have had this setup but usually wind up switching it to extended for say when im playin a flight sim or something keeping main game on one and map on the other. the other question is if i have 2 65inch 4k and 3d tv's should i get another new monitor specifically branded as a pc monitor and not a tv? i still dont get why there is a difference if tv's are 4k and run at a high hrtz or mabey i am missing something. monitors are the only aspect of pc building i guess i dont understand so please go easy one me lol i could build a quantum in the dark blindfolded if i had the components but monitors i got no f'n clue. thanks guys!,monitor setup question,0

1755,"Hello,

Just got a custom SH midrange PC three months ago, and it has been going well so far, with the PC able to run basically whatever I have given it. But after today, something must have happened, because as soon as I launch any game (such as Deus Ex: Mankind Divided), and it gets past the splash screen, the GPU fan seems to speed up, then the monitor signal is lost, and the sound loops, which is a textbook GPU crash (I think). The PC eventually restarts on its own. Verified the Events and checked the BugCode and apparently it's got something to do with a TDR crash if the information from Google is correct. 

More notable things that did happen are freezes for like 5-10 seconds, and I could predict them by the fact that the game would stop loading scripts or assets (seen in Dishonored 2, the subtitles would be displayed and only after the freeze, the sound would sync up; same issue in Deus Ex: Mankind Divided as well, which are games on two completely different engines) occurring in every game. These did not happen in the first two months of having the PC. Must also mention that the PC starts a bit hard, the keyboard LEDs and the monitor take a while to light up.

My theory is that the PSU must be dying, as it is a very cheap 320 watts one, and using a PSU Calculator, the amount needed would be 480 watts minimum for the system to run at least stable. Should I replace my PSU or is it a different problem entirely? 

Thank you in advance!

**An ASUS C621e SAGE motherboard in open box condition was offered for sale for just around $25.** 

I read the description thoroughly and looked at the seller's reputation. Concluded nothing wrong with them, I decided to try my luck and bought this board anyway. I did not expect anything from the seller since I thought it was probably a scam or they would only send an empty box.

The item has just arrived this evening. I was surprised to find out that it is the real motherboard. It arrived in a brown ASUS box with the retail box inside.

I am more than excited! It seems that the board is never used, but the box has been opened. The only thing that is missing is the I/O shield. I know that the Xeon CPU is pretty expensive (Skylake-EP or CascadeLake-EP). If I continue to build with this platform, I plan to find cheaper ES or QS Xeon CPU (may need custom BIOS).

1. I can't decide which one to buy: Ryzen 7 3700X or Ryzen 7 3800X. The price difference is 25 euros, so I would like to take the 3800X, but the 3800X uses 105W while 3700X uses only 65W. I have a 500W PSU and I was wondering how will it affect the electricity bill and will my PSU be able to handle that.
2. I guess that 3800X and 3700X are boosted quite a lot already, but more boost/overclocking comes with more energy consumption. What could be an approximate increase in power for both of those CPUs if I overclock them to 4.0 GHz? I have looked at those electricity calculators and they show roughly 400W with 3800X, so I should have the 100W left. Won't there happen situations that my GPU runs above base clock speed and the CPU as well and my computer goes into Hiroshima mode?

The 3700X is more than enough for me as I am upgrading from i5 6400, but I would like to go even further with 3800X if it doesn't get my wallet empty with an electricity bill. I am pairing it with a GTX 1070.

Dell says the monitor has an oc mode which can push it to 120hz, so Im not sure if this kind of oc is ""damaging""/shorten the life time of the monitor or if its made for using it with 120hz?

Hello /r/pcmasterrace, I currently own a Samsung S22D300, It's a decent monitor i've had for quiet a very long time. It's a 1080p 60hz purchase i've made back when i had no idea what a 60hz monitor meant, I'm still by no means experienced in monitors, But i was playing on my friends laptop recently and i literally felt my eyes being cleansed, it's a huge difference between my 60hz and his 144hz, So i decided to by one, But i have no idea what to buy.

I've looked online for some and these are some great options i found:  
ROG STRIX XG27VQ

SAMSUNG C24RG50 (This one is actually 240hz)

It has to be a 1440p 144hz, preferably curved. I've heared 27' is the sweet spot for most gamers but i'm not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

1794,"Hello friends, today I'd like to talk about an aspect of our glorious systems that get overlooked a lot: our audio experience on our battlestations. 

I've been building systems for myself and others since I randomly took a buildapc course in middle school (currently 28) and enjoy music very much (I grew up on linkin park, dre, biggie smalls, 3 6 mafia, tupac, ac/dc, red hot chilli peppers am fond of electro and dubstep and various genres of music). I have 2 decades of experience playing saxophone, clarinet, and the electric guitar, and have performed in jazz bands, rock bands, and an orchestra. 


So occasionally while answering questions on this subreddit (mainly on why new builder's systems aren't posting, or what components they should get, or just mourning with fellow builders for systems that have passed on) I would come across the occasional ""what speakers/headphones are best under $xx"" and with the state of pc products being ""gaming rgb ultimate series XLR"" or , it's hard to discern what audio products are *actually* worth your money. Note that if you are using just ""good enough"" cheap speakers, any of the speakers/headphones on this list will blow your mind away. Get ready to enter a new world of audio.


Now, I totally understand using simple logitech speakers due to budget/space/easy-access from best buy or not knowing about the wider audio world. So I am here today to give you a perspective on what audio components are TRULY worth your hard-earned cash. I have owned $20 logitech speakers in college, I have owned guitar amps as well as studio monitors/other speakers ranging from $100-$1500. Do know that all of this information is readily available in /r/BudgetAudiophile   /r/audiophile and /r/headphones . I am merely condensing all of it into a single list, and attempt to sort of explain it to the pc builders, or just an idiot rambling.

Couple things to note: I originally thought I would make a 5 minute low effort post with just a list of speakers and headphones, but this turned out to be longer than I originally anticipated. If I repeat myself in certain sections, it is because I wrote this abomination in multiple sessions with edits....or I'm just an idiot...probably the latter. If you would like more information on specific speakers, I would check out reviewers on youtube like zerofidelity, steve guttenberg, nextbigthing (nbt) studios, and thomas and stereo. For headphones, metal751, innerfidelity, Ishca's written reviews, DMS. 

Z reviews is okay and he reviews everything from amps and dacs to speakers and headphones, but he gives 90% of his products good reviews, and has affiliate links to every single product he reviews....so you see where my dislike of him as a reviewer comes from. He still knows his shit and is a great entertainer whilst talking about audio products.

Also with speakers, speaker placement is extremely important. Get those speakers off your desk and the woofers/tweeters to your ear level NO MATTER THE COST. Stack boxes/books, buy speaker stands/isolation pads from amazon, at worst buy yoga blocks from amazon. Put your speakers on them, get ready for even better audio.

General rule of thumb: dont buy HiFi at msrp. There are ALWAYS deals on speakers/headphones to take advantage of at any given time (massdrop for headphones, parts-express, accessories4less). Speakers will get cheaper over time as manufacturers have to make room for new products/refreshes of the same models just as with headphones. If theres a particular headphone model you want, check to see if massdrop has it (website where users of the website decide what niche products the website will mass order, and both the website and you the users get reduced pricing).

Now this list is just simple guide. Obviously for $150 budget, theres probably like 10 different speakers to choose from. You will catch me repeat this many many times but sound is subjective, I don't know what genres of music you enjoy and what sound signatures in headphones/speakers you would prefer (warm sounds? bright? aggressively forward? laid back sound signature? importance of clarity vs bass?) So consider this list with a grain of salt, as this is after all, the ramblings of an idiot on reddit. 


So I will be splitting this list into 3 categories: active speakers, passive speakers, headphones and amps/dacs. And before I start, bass depth and low end does not fuc**** equal boomy bass. I absolutely detest low quality boomy bass like in Beats headphones and general ""gaming speakers"" or w/e. 

Active vs. Passive (crude explanation)

So when a speaker plays music from your pc, the audio is processed by the audio card on your motherboard, which is then sent to the amplifier where the signal is amplified, and then finally is sent to be played on your speakers. Active speakers like logitech speakers that have a power cable running from the speakers directly to the wall socket have built-in amplifiers to power the speakers, whereas passive speakers require a separate amplifier to amplify the audio signal and feed the speakers power. Active vs passive, no real difference as both types of speakers will have good audio quality depending on how they are made and which ones you buy, but in the ultra budget section of speakers (under $300) actives tend to be cheaper than their passive counter parts. This is due to the manufacturer cutting corners elsewhere.

 Take for instance the Micca MB42X passive speakers($90) which also have a brother, the Micca PB42X ($120) powered speakers. Same exact speaker, but built in amp vs the amp you buy. Obviously the mb42x will sound marginally better purely from the virtue that the amplifier you buy will be better than the shitty one in the pb42x. But the mb42x + amp + speaker wire will probably cost you anywhere from basic $130 to $200 with difference in amplifier and whether you use bare speaker wire or banana plugs/cables. Cabling aesthetics and management will be greatly affected, with sound quality affected to a lesser degree, or more (but at what cost?). Amp choice to be explained later.

Now generally speakers should be recommended based on your music/audio preferences and tastes as speakers and in a larger part, speaker brands will have their own unique sound signatures that some will love and others will hate as sound is such a *subjective* experience. But since this is meant to cater to a wide audience, note that my list is not the ALL inclusive, and again is only the ramblings of an idiot.

BLUETOOTH SPEAKERS

If you want to add bluetooth capabilities to your wires active or passive speakers, simply buy the esinkin W29 wireless bluetooth module, plug your speakers in, connect to your bluetooth on pc/phone/w/e, enjoy.

ACTIVE SPEAKERS

Note: you may experience a hissing with active speakers that may annoy you to no end even up to the $400 mark. This is a result of the amplifier being built in to the speaker in close proximity, as well as sometimes the manufacturer cutting corners elsewhere. Passive speakers do not have this unless you buy a really shitty amp. Note that while bigger woofer size does *not* necessarily indicate better quality/bass, this does more often than not seem to be the case as manufacturers put bigger woofers on the higher stepup model.

* Cyber Acoustics CA-3602FFP 2.1 $40. This is the I'm broke af but I need speakers route. 2.1 setup for 40 bucks. We do not have the luxury of options here. Enough said. Amazon

* Okay, for under $100 for good quality active speakers, there really is no other choice here besides Edifier speakers on amazon. In fact, their entire lineup is pretty solid all around ranging from the 980T for $70 to the S350DB which is a 2.1 system with 2 bookshelves and a sub for $300. Differences in the models are basically bigger woofers/tweeters as you go up in price, resulting in better bass performance and clarity (again crude explanation). If you don't want to research much and want simplicity, any of the edifiers are the way to go, with the 1700BT being the goto 2.0, or the 1850db which as a sub-out so you can add in a subwoofer into your setup later. 


* Micca PB42X: $120- The active version of the popular MB42X passive speakers. Very good performance for price.
 
* Mackie CR3/4 $90/$140- Now normally I don't recommend these, but they are *okay*/meh speakers and have that razer aesthetic going on, and aesthetics are big part of speaker choice, so if you like the black/green color scheme, I guess these are passable. 
 
* Klipsch Pro Media 2.1: $150- the only 2.1 system I'd recommend under $200. The thing about adding in a subwoofer to a 2.1 system under $200 means they have to cut corners elsewhere. This is the main difference of 2.1 systems vs bookshelves. While the subwoofer will allow your music to hit the lower notes in frequency resulting in deeper and more bass, this will usually come at a cost of audio quality in the mid and upper ranges in the music. If you are a BASSHEAD then yeah you probably want a subwoofer, though bookshelves under $200 also have decent bass. Note, ALWAYS BETTER TO BUY BOOKSHELVES AND SUBWOOFER SEPARATELY, but this will be pricier. Klipsch Website Direct or amazon.
 
* Fluance ai40/ai60: $200/$300- nice looking speakers that come in white and walnut and black that also have good clarity and quality. Their bass is surprisingly okay as they are rated to go a little bit below in the lower frequencies than speakers in similar price. I have listened to these before shortly for 2 hours, and would recommend. IIRC the ai60 has a subwoofer out. Mind the size of the 60s, quite big. Fluance direct or amazon.
 
* Kanto YU4: $270 Direct competitor to fluance ai series. Comes in white as well.
 
* Audioengine A2+/A5+ :$270/$400. I have no experience with this lineup, but lots of love/hate dynamic with this brand over on budgetaudiophile. Good and bad thing.

* JBL 305P: $300 - maybe the endgame speakers of this list. These are very famous and respected studio monitors that music artists and producers use often. They are sold $150 per speaker, and you will need to get 2. Hooking them up requires separate cables, as these are standalone speakers with it's own volume control on **each speaker**. Simplest way is to buy a 3.5mm to dual TS Cable. Set both speakers to same physical volume level via knob, and adjust volume using windows settings (having a volume knob on your keyboard helps immensely here). Or buy a separate in line volume control from amazon ($20 bucks or under) and connect via 3.5mm to rca. Being studio monitors, these are meant to reproduce sound neutrally (they will have no external flavoring like how Beats adds muddy boomy bass to its headphones to use as a bad example) and may not sound alive or bright or to your tastes. They can be demo-ed/tested out at guitar center if you have access to one in this pandemic.

* Logitech G560 $200: Okay, now normally I'd be crucified for recommending a logitech speaker in the other audio forums. But I have used these speakers briefly for about 3 months when I got them cheap from a friend. The sound quality of these satellite speakers are....surprisingly not bad? Might I dare to say that these are even....decent for it's price? Now these are $200 speakers for a 2.1 system. This means that it's either this or Klipsch 2.1. Honestly my vote here goes to the logitechs. I owned the Klipsch promedia 2.1 for about half a year. I can definitely say I prefer the clarity of the logitechs vs the boomy bass of the Klipsch. The subwoofer on the 560 does NOT have its own control knob, so you would need to adjust bass settings through logitech eq. Note, these speakers will not sound good out of the box. You will need to go into the eq settings via logitech software, and change the settings to match your tastes. But with a little elbow grease, you have a good 2.1 system that also looks good if you're enjoy the RGB. Note that I am not recommending the z623/625. Don't get those. I used these in college in my apt in brooklyn, and while boomy bass, I'd definitely go with the B652 + mini amp, klipsch 2.1, or the g560 over the z623/625 FOR SURE.


PASSIVE SPEAKERS

These speakers will require you to buy a separate amplifier, as well as separate cables. But the passive route allows you to have a modular audio system that allows you to upgrade parts as you go along in your life, or even just add parts in altogether (like having a miniamp on your desk for your passive speakers, having a separate dac or bluetooth module for your speakers so you can connect the passive speakers via USB or bluetooth wirelessly, stacked on top of a headphone dac/amp combo, stacked on top of a preamp, etc). Amplifier list to follow later.

Passive speaker specs to pay attention to will be their impedance (measured in ohms) and their sensitivity (measured in xx db/1w/1m). Speaker ratings in wattage are measurements of how much power can be driven to them (higher watts, higher volume...once again crude explanation). A 20 watt x 2 channel amp (measured in 4 ohms) is enough to power 4 and 6 ohm speakers rated at 100 watts to moderate/decently loud listening levels on your desktop. Now the sensitivity thing. A speaker with a rating of 85db/1m/1w means it will produce 85 decibels of noise at 1 meter with 1 watt of power. Now this not linear....to make the same speaker go up to 90 decibels may require 10 or 15 watts of power depending on other variables. Depending on how loudly you play your music and what impedance/sensitivity your speakers have will result in your choice of amplifiers. More on this later. 

The thing about bookshelf speakers are that you can use them in your desktop setup, AND with your TV as a legitimate starter 2.1 home theater setup (which you can upgrade to 3.1, and then 5.1/5.2, just buy a used receiver from craigslist for 50 bucks, ez)


Note that passive speakers and amp require you to purchase [speaker wire](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006LW0WDQ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=speaker+wire&amp;qid=1592523742&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExS09HMkRXT1FNUk9JJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDQ4ODYwVUcyMU44WE1RNDJGJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA2ODk2OTEzNENGVUVPM08yWEZOJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) separately (fairly cheap) and strip them (youtube video will guide you, very easy). Or if you like clean cable management and easy setups, [banana plug cables](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Speaker-Cable-Gold-Plated-Banana/dp/B07FKJDTPY/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=banana+plug+cable&amp;qid=1592523826&amp;sr=8-3) from amazon will set you straight, and while these cables are very nice, they will add up in cost as your buy more of them for frankenstein 2.1 cabling. Also a [3.5mm to rca cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-3-5mm-2-Male-Adapter-Stereo/dp/B01D5H8KO2/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=3.5mm+to+rca&amp;qid=1592525318&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFBRDBCUlE2UjZIRlImZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAyNzY1MTkzTElSSTdSNkdMNkQ5JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA2OTYwMjMyOFZINDYwNUwzU1NVJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) will be required. The connection will be your pc -&gt; 3.5mm-&gt;rca-&gt;amp-&gt;speaker wire-&gt; speaker wire-&gt;speaker. (replace speaker wire with banana plug if going that route). Subwoofer connection will be explained in subwoofer section.

* Dayton audio b652+ mini amp combo on parts-express for $60/70. Two combos, two separate mini amps, one from lepai (china) and one from dayton. Same shit. It ***LITERALLY*** does not get better than this for under $100, maybe even 
 $150. CHIEF THIS IS IT, i cannot stress this enough. This is the budgetaudiophile 101 starter pack. I'd recommend these over the active Mackies, Edifiers (up to the 1700), and any and all logitech/creative pebble/cyber w/e EVERYTHING systems (except for the g560). These are very BIG speakers and hence will deliver good sound and good bass due to its big woofers. If you have less than $100 to spend on the ENTIRE audio setup, go get these and speaker wire/banana plugs no questions asked. gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
 
* Dayton Audio B652 AIR $70- The difference between the AIR and the normal 652 is in the tweeter. The AIR tweeter on this speaker costs as much as the entire b652 speaker. This tweeter upgrade gives even more clarity and quality in the treble range (middle upper sound frequency). The next best thing for under $100, though doesn't come with the  mini amp combo.
 
* Sony SSCS5 Bookshelf Speakers. $150 msrp, $120 on amazon/bestbuy until recently, and sometimes goes on sale for $75. These are 3 way speakers with woofer, tweeter and supertweeter. The strength of these speakers lie in its unmatched clarity in the highs and upper mids. I still have these in my collection, and VERY WORTH though my opinion of these is skewed as I got them for $75/pair. If you appreciate bass, you will need to add a subwoofer with these (or generally any speaker below $500....some people would say you cant listen to music on bookshelves without subwoofer) as they sound a bit thin compare to the b652s (a bit less bass because smaller woofer) but better sound quality (though this is just my SUBJECTIVE thought after listening to the cs5s and b652s). These have 5 in woofers and have okayish small form factor.
 
* Micca MB42X $90- the passive version of the powered PB42X in the active list. The difference is between the amplifier built into the PB42X vs the one you're going to buy separately to power the MB42X. Obv the MB42X route is going to be better because the amplifier in the PB42X will be shit compared to the one you're going to buy ($30/50/75/150 options to follow later)
 
* Micca RB42X $150 - Amazing small size speakers. For under $200, either this or the cs5s. The rb42s have a bit more bass. 

* Elac Debut 5.2/6.2 ON SALE NOW FOR $230/250. GET EM WHILE IT LASTS. Normally $280/350. These are speakers highly acclaimed by many of the speaker reviewers I consider the best (imo zerofidelity, steve guttenberg, nextbigthing (nbt) studio, thomas and stereo). Great bass, warm sound signature. Just go, what are you waiting for. GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
 
* Q Acoustics 3020/3030i $230/400. Highly acclaimed by reviewers, look VERY NICE in white, and have a warm sound signature with lots of bass clarity and bass depth. These speakers are big, which is why they have great bass. Check the dimensions. Their size is the only downside to these fantastic speakers. 

* PSB Alpha P5 $400: Great speakers for nearfield listening, aka at your desk, excels in this department more so than the other speakers (better at low volume, etc). Just all around amazing. Get these if the Q Acoustics ones are too big. 
 
* Triangle BR02/03 $450/550. Coming from across the atlantic, these french speakers made a splash last year destroying its competition in the below $1000 range. Highly acclaimed to the point where some see them as overrated (too much hype out of nowhere in such little time). If you have the space in your setup as well as in your wallet for these, they are the way to go. Comes in black, walnut, white. 


AMPLIFIERS

Okay here is where we need to get into specific numbers. Active speakers have built-in amplifiers so they are exempt. But passive speakers will require separate amps and so you will need to pay attention to certain specs. In speakers you will need to pay attention to their impedance (measured in ohms) and their sensitivity (measured in xx db/1m/1w). The typical mini amplifier will be class D (small form factor amps for desktop use) and their wattage per channel will be usually expressed in 4ohms. Take for instance the popular SMSL SA50. This is an amp that delivers 50 watts to its 2 channels, rated at 4 ohms. Speakers will have impedance of 4, 6, or 8 ohms usually. 50 watts at 4 ohms can be 25 watts at 8 ohms, but is probably more like 20 watts at 8 ohms, refer to product specs for specific wattage ratings at specific ohms. Speakers with high sensitivity (85-95 db/1w/1m) that have 6 ohm impedance are easier to drive with lower wattage. 

But here's the thing, an the smsl sa50 will not deliver 50 CLEAN watts. Somewhere in the 30-40w range distortion will start to appear. But for reference, 30 clean watts is enough to drive sony cs5s to uncomfortably loud levels in an apartment (the whole apt, not just your room) so listening on your desktop, you only really need 10-15 clean watts. Do note that if you have the space, a used AV Receiver that will just shit out watts and have 5.1 surround will be the best, but these things are massive.
 
* Lepai 2020ti (LEPAI and not Lepy be wary) $25. 20 watts in 2 channels. Budget
 
* SMSL SA36 $62: SMSL's 2x20w.
 
* SMSL SA50 $72: The most bang for buck amp that's also decent. 2x50watts.
 
* Topping MX3 $130: Speaker amp, headphone amp, dac rolled into one. Allows for your speakers and headphones to be connected via USB and Bluetooth.
 
* SMSL AD18 $150: SMSL's answer to the MX3. This one is probably the goto. It's got 2x80w at 4ohms, has USB connection, has subwoofer out, has bluetooth connection, headphone amp, coaxial and optical connection.

If you need more watts than the AD18, you're gonna need to get a class a/b amp that just shits out watts for cheap, or get a used av receiver. If you want a new one, the best budget option is the DENON AVR-S540BT 5.2 channel AVR from accessories4less.

SUBWOOFERS

Good subwoofers are expensive, and cheap subwoofers will hurt your listening experience rather than improve it (muddy boomy shitty bass). Your best bet may be to simply find a used subwoofer from craigslist or offerup, ***just dont get the polk audio PSW10***, this is a very common sub you see on the 2nd hand market, because it is a shitty sub and so people get rid of it. Now as to whether you need a subwoofer. If you are in a dorm, don't get a subwoofer. Because.... if you live in a dorm, ***do not get a fucking subwoofer***. Now if you live in a small apartment, fear not, proper subwoofer management will save you noise complaints. A *good* subwoofer will produce good quality low end you can hear and feel without having to turn up the volume. You want to look at the subwoofer's lowest frequency it can go to. That will show you how ""tight"" the bass will be. Now, low volume levels on a good sub will produce that bass for you without vibrating your walls (though subwoofer and speaker isolation 

 Now as to how to add a subwoofer to your system will depend on what setup you have and the available connections. If your speakers or amplifier has a subwoofer output, simply connect that to your subwoofer, set the crossover freuency (the frequency at which the subwoofer will start making sound) to 80hz, or lower depending on how low of a frequency our bookshelves can go down to.

If your speakers/amp do not have a subwoofer out, you will need to find a subwoofer that has [high level speaker inputs](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/7YZ9CFXLRa57uP6ishb-04bIPeRYvqSwymdRkaVqf5oo5yd8nM4Wq-2gWUhx10k6djISu2-BjQJ9iBPhcDvoZtelAxmUFtAA_Bvej1gaPL3fkk_OUBa29vz4D90KZHE0k2rPX_VPD5f6Hew) . You will need to connect your bookshelves to the speaker outputs on the subwoofer via speaker wire/banana plugs, and then run speaker wire/banana plugs from the subwoofer input to your amplifier, ending with rca to 3.5mm connection to your pc. 

* Dayton Audio SUB-800 $100: The cheapest one, don't go any cheaper. Enough said. Get from parts-express. If you need cheaper, 2nd hand market.
 
* Dayton Sub-1000 $120: The bigger brother. This thing is 10 inches, be prepared for a BIG box sitting in your room.
 
* Dayton Sub-1500 $200. The even bigger brother. I'm sorry, that's just how good these things are.
 
* SVS SB-1000 $500: Bassssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss.


HEADPHONES

Okay, I keep saying headphones and not headsets right. But you ask, Kilroy, you're an idiot. You're posting on buildapc for PC gamers and builders but you're talking headphones and not headsets. How idiotic are you? Pretty big, but friends hear me out. Now I used to live in South Korea, where PC Bangs (internet cafes) set the nation's standards for computers. All the places had to get the best bang for the buck pc gear to stay in business and remain competitive (all 100 computers at these places had like i5-6600k and gtx 1080 in 2015 or something I don't remember, along with mechanical BLUE SWITCH FUCCCCCCKKKKKKKK (imagine 100 blue switch keyboards being smashed on in a small underground area in Seoul) keyboards and decent headsets.

So I have tried MANY MANY different headsets, here is my conclusion. Just get proper headphones and get either get an antlion modmic, or V-MODA Boompro mic both available on amazon. (short list of mics later) or get proper headphones and usb mic. The TWO EXCEPTIONS that I have observed to this rule are the Hyperx Clouds and Cooler Master mh751/752. 


* Hyperx Cloud CORE/1/2/ALPHA (please find prices on amazon). So these headphones are a rare instance of when a gaming branded pair of headphones was actually a good no bullshit product. These are hyperx reskins of OEM Takstar Pro 80, a pretty damn good pair of cans from china for under $50 (no longer available on aliexpress but Seoul had a SHIT load of these) with a mic attached to it. Chief, this is it. Reasonably good audio quality from headphone drivers for their price, and you get a mic for discord needs.
 
* Coolermaster MH751/752 $90/110. Now beware, on amazon there are the mh630/650/670 series headphones that are in the same...product ""selection"" styling part of the product page. Do NOT GET THESE, these are the typical bullshit gaming branding and are pretty bad. Now, the mh751 and 752s are coolermaster's copycat of the hyperx clouds. They are coolermaster reskins of the Takstar pro 82, another good pair of headphones. I cannot comment on this one, as I have not used either the takstar variant nor the cm variant. But the pro 82s are just as good as the 80s. If i had to guess, different styling (headband) and maybe slightly different sound signature. Difference between the 2 is the dac (the block thing in between your headphones and the wires to your pc). The dac the mh752 is most likely inferior to the dac on your mobo's build-in soundcard. Get the 751, unless you have a laptop, then the 752's dac may be better.

* Audio-Technica ath-m40x $80: You may have heard of the ath-m50/x. Now these headphones are looked down on, on the headphone forums or reddit. The m40/x is the bass reduced, aka the neutral version of the m50x for cheaper too. Great headphones for under $100. Now, I have owned the m50 waay back, and I think if you enjoy bass, then go for it. After all, they are YOUR fuckin pair of headphones and ears, who are others to say shit?
 
* Sony MDR7506 $100: I remember these were $75, but I guess everything changed when the coronavirus attacked. Anyway, these are the venerated mdr7506, the industry standard for headphones in the professional audio/music industry. Great quality, cheap price. They just, dont have anything going on in the looks department. These are it for pure price/performance. 
 
* BeyerDynamic DT770 (32, 90, 250 ohms) $150: Amazing pair of cans, very comfortable. 32 ohm version if simply plugging into your motherboard. The higher ohm versions require separate headphone amp. Generally more amps=better audio quality.
 
* [HiFiMAN HE4XX](https://drop.com/buy/drop-hifiman-he4xx-planar-magnetic-headphones?clickid=zt5S92zOvxyOWEvwUx0Mo34GUkiyU8XFQ1%3Ab0E0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_term=252901&amp;utm_content=DROP%20-%20Steven%20Ciofalo&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=impactradius&amp;utm_placement=&amp;utm_keyword=&amp;mode=shop_open) $160: Simply amazing. Open back planar headphones. 

* Sennheiser 650/6xx from massdrop/660 $220-$400. The legendary series of headphones from sennheiser. Highly venerated.


WIRELESS HEADSETS

Okay. Wireless headsets, now let's think why do you need a wireless headset? Do you want to walk around your house while on discord? Maybe you want to keep the headset on while having to afk real quick for a smoke break or whatnot. 

* TaoTronics 5.0 Bluetooth transmitter+receiver unit $30. It's a small device that can either A: give your non-bt PC bluetooth capabilities by acting as a receiver, or give your wired headphones wireless connectivity to your pc by acting as a transmitter. This thing is battery powered (like a wireless gaming headset) up to 10 hours. You just plug your wired headphones in, put the thing in your pocket and leave your pc.

MICS

* V-MODA BoomPRO $30: this is a mic with a 3.5mm that plugs in to your headphones that have a removable cable, simple.
 
* Antlion modmic $50: yes the modmic. You've probably heard of this.
 
* Fifine K669B condensor mic $46: simple mic on a stand that plugs in via usb. Imo has better recording quality than Blue snowball.
 
* Blue Snowball $57: Yes, you've most definitely heard of this.

I don’t know what the tape is exactly for, it maybe for insulation or it serves as a backplate for the GPU.

And what should I do if I need to tape it back? It’s very loose. And I assume when the system operates it’ll blow off the tape.

Game being played/tested on - COD

So a couple weeks ago i decided to upgrade my GPU from an  AMD Radeon RX 470 to the GEFORCE 2060 Super in the PL above. At first it seemed to be running well but now after a couple weeks i am noticing frames being dropped. This mosly happens when i enter a room or when another player(s) enter the frame. I also have to keep my AC below 75, with my case side glass removed to provide cool air or else the frame dropping is unbearable, i closed the case once and the fans started ramping after a few mins. After a while of playing the top of the GPU will be hot to the touch.

1876,"Heya. It's been awhile since i've been to the subreddit, but it looks glorious as always.
I have my 2 case fans linked up to my cpu fan via a molex PWM wiring setup. For years its been working great, though uh..
A few nights ago, i spilled water on my desk, and panicked. It got all over the keyboard, and I ran to get a towel. started sweeping the water off, and accidentally hit the sleep button, then realised it may have gotten in the computer too. (I have an intake fan on the face, and outtake on the back near the cpu.)
The computer buescreened, and the fans were going loudly. I cant recall if they were already loud before, but i was playing terraria with a friend at the time, i wouldnt be surprised if the fans were going.
I turn it off, check all the individual components, see nothing unusual, and reassemble it. I took it as an excuse to put it back together in a new case.

Well, i turn it on the next day, and everythings working. Though, the new case isnt set up as nicely.. the harddrive storage area kind of blocks the intake fan.
so, all the fans are synced to the cpu fan, and this has worked great for years.

Well, now when i use sleep mode, and turn it back on, the fans are acting really weird. Any time it touches 48C it throttles all the fans, and jitters back and forth aggressively. I only learned about 48C because of AMD overdrive. 
The temperatures are kind of varied, as well. the core temperatures are fine and sit around 29C, but TMPIN1 is saying around 40-48C constantly.
This makes all the fans jitter around stupidly, sometimes going up and down within miliseconds. 

Anyone have experience with this, or think it could be related to the spill?
Maybe need new thermal paste, or the cpufan is busted?

\--------------------

Not sure why this information isn't being spread on their website... but as a lefty I'll take the good news.  For those not aware the original lefty Naga released in 2014 and they are now extremely hard to find at a reasonable price.  Many of us have slowly failing mice and this release from RAZER is a big deal to those of us that love having a mouse that fits our sinful use of the left hand.

I know this community tends to have a love-hate relationship with the quality of RAZER products... but please, if you know someone that could use a new lefty mouse let them know.  RAZER is the only company willing to lose money to produce a mouse that I personally could not go without.  I've been dreading the day my Naga finally dies because I use it for everything; be it working in Unreal Engine for my day job or playing a game... I cannot go without the twelve extra buttons I've gained since 2014.  I know it may not make much sense to you righties so I'll try to explain.  Imagine using the NUMPAD for every game you play.  NUM 8/4/5/6 is your WASD... you have no easy access to the 1 - = keys on the left side of the keyboard making certain games nearly impossible to play because unfortunately you were born the 1980's and humans were not born with three hands quite yet.

\-----------

Bottom line show RAZER some love regardless of what you think of their products.  They deserve it for doing something they clearly don't need to.",RAZER is a few weeks away from launching an updated LH [Left-Handed] Naga. If you know anyone that would need one now is the time to let them know to be on the look out. Love or hate RAZER this is the first time since 2014 us lefties are getting a new mouse.,0

1945,"Just brought this beauty home earlier today. Each line is incomplete/truncated in the document they printed and I'm not sure if the information missing can be inferred from the part that is on the sheet here.

Motherboard: GIGABYTE B360M AORUS GAMING 3 

CPU: Intel Core i7-9700F 12MB Cache 3.00-4.70GHz

RAM: 2x 8GB HyperX Fury 3000MHz DDR4 CL16

SSD: Adata SU630 480GB SATA 520MB/s read speed \*

GPU: VGA GeForce RTX2070 Super 8GB DDR6 256 Bits

Power supply: Corsair 650W 80 Plus

I can't get actual specs on the computer itself because I'm stuck at work while it's sitting in my bedroom right now. I didn't even have time to take it out of the box when I got home with it.

(\*) I only noticed the SSD read speed after I pulled the trigger on it. Before purchasing this computer, I saw some SSDs with a 6GB/s speed elsewhere, or at least that's what the vendors claim. Also I ended up not purchasing any HDDs because I was on a budget. Being a laptop user all my life I didn't even have any peripherals so...

Anyways, the idea is to play VR games on my Odyssey+. I hope this one can handle the task. My current setup is an unmodded Microsoft Surface Book 2, which has a notebook GTX1060 built in. It works with No Man's Sky and lightly-modded SkyrimVR but for some reason more often than not it fails to launch Beat Saber, or it does launch but stutters so much you can't really play it as it's a fast rhythm game. So like I said I hope this new desktop will be up to the task!",Rate my setup,0
